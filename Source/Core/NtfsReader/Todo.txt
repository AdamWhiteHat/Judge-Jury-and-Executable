Use Overlapped IO or threading to reduce CPU processing latency between reads 
   (in RetrieveMode.Minimal I get 200MB/s read, in RetrieveMode.Full only 150MB/s)
   
Maybe add FileRead capability
   (need to experiment with reading a lot of small files with classic mode and directly from Ntfs)
	    to reduce seek time, we could also implement something that read the data in the disk order
	    something like.. I have 4000 of those 1kb files to retrieve... retrieve them in the order you want but retrieve them fast!
	    And it would callback the caller for each complete file retrieval... something like that...

Add Events while processing to allow client apps to display cluster map in realtime (like JkDefrag does...)

Try to reduce memory footprint of the Full mode even more...

Add support for Substitute (DOS Subs) and Locally mapped network drive
